# conformance delta: fuzz-validator-targets

Advances `CONF-FUZZ-NO-PANIC`. Extends the parsers-never-panic guarantee from
three descriptor/envelope entry points to every untrusted-input surface,
including the validator API and both container formats. No AV2 syntax change.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: every untrusted-input surface has fuzz coverage

Every public entry point that consumes arbitrary bytes SHALL be reachable
from at least one cargo-fuzz target: the descriptor and OBU-envelope readers,
the IVF container parser, the container auto-detect, and the `splot-validate`
validator API (which transitively dispatches every OBU payload parser). The
CI fuzz-smoke job SHALL enumerate and run every target rather than a
hardcoded subset.

#### Scenario: a payload parser panics on hostile input

- **WHEN** any OBU payload parser reachable from `Validator::validate_bytes`
  panics, hangs, or exceeds the RSS limit on a fuzzer-generated input
- **THEN** the `validate_bytes` fuzz target crashes and the blocking CI
  fuzz-smoke job fails

#### Scenario: a new fuzz target is added

- **WHEN** a new target is added under `fuzz/fuzz_targets/`
- **THEN** the CI fuzz-smoke job and `cargo xtask fuzz` pick it up without a
  workflow edit (targets are enumerated, not hardcoded)

### Requirement: validator no-panic property tests on stable

`splot-validate` SHALL have property tests asserting that validating arbitrary
bytes under arbitrary validator options returns a report and never panics, so
the no-panic invariant is enforced on the stable toolchain in `cargo test`
where nightly-only fuzzing is unavailable.

#### Scenario: arbitrary input on stable

- **WHEN** `cargo test -p splot-validate` runs the property tests on the
  pinned stable toolchain
- **THEN** `Validator::validate_bytes_with_options` returns a
  `ValidationReport` for every generated input without panicking
